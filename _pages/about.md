<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming PhD student at the Daniel J. Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, **University of Southern California (USC)**. I obtained my BSc in Mathematics at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, during which I also studied abroad as an exchange student at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I feel fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Gary Pui Tung Choi](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~ptchoi/index.html) at CUHK and [Prof. Yangyang Xu](https://xu-yangyang.github.io/index.html) at RPI during my undergraduate studies.


My research interests include continuous optimization and mathematics of materials.



# News

My first research paper is accepted by [Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences.](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspa) Thanks to Professor Gary Choi's patient guidance.
